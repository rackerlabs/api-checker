# Releases #
## In Progress Work ##
1. Clean up: Optimized the configuration for one of the unit tests to improve build times.

## Release 2.0.2 (2016-10-17) ##
1. Updated Dependencies
   1. saxon: 9.5.1-8 → 9.7.0-8
   1. wadl-tools: 1.0.32 → 1.0.33
   1. jackson-databind: 2.2.3 → 2.8.1
1. Added ```rax:authenticatedBy``` extension, the extension works exactly like ```rax:roles``` but allows the specification of an authentication method (```PASSCODE```, ```PASSWORD```, etc) rather than a role.
1. XPath 3.1 is now supported in ```plain``` parameters.
1. It is now possible to specify ```plain``` parameters on JSON media types via XPath 3.1. The variables ```$_``` or ```$body``` can be used to specify the content body.
1. The config item ```xsdEngine``` now applies when validating checker format, so that SaxonEE can be used to pre-validate a state machine before loading it.
1. Clean up: We now compile XSLs one time at startup instead of every time a Validator is created.
1. Integrated with [Nailgun](http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/) to speed up startup performance of CLI utilities.
1. Fixed a bug where header parameters were incorrectly treated as case sensitive in a WADL.
1. Fixed a bug where header quality (and other parameters) were preventing matches of header values.
1. Fixed a bug where multiple ```wadl:doc``` elements on a single method were causing the processing of a WADL to fail.
1. Fixed a bug where metadata extension (```rax:metadata```) was inadvertently introducing invalid WADLs in the pipeline.

## Release 2.0.1 (2016-08-06) ##
1. Fixed a bug where a call to getInputStream was not invalidating cached XML/JSON.
1. Fixed a bug where comments and spaces were not properly maintained in XML bodies when the XML was processed.
1. Fixed a bug where including a new line in an URL caused validation to fail.
1. Fixed a bug where an error in parsing XML or JSON resulted in the request input stream being closed.
1. Fixed a bug where the ```fixed``` attribute in a template parameter was not being taken into account.
1. API checker now follows RFC 7234 recommendation of adding a Warning header whenever it modifies a request body.  The feature can be disabled with the ```enableWarnHeaders``` configuration option.

## Release 2.0.0 (2016-05-24) ##
This release introduces breaking changes. Refer to [BREAKING.md](BREAKING.md) for details.

1. Updated Dependencies
   1. scala: 2.10.3 → 2.11.7
   1. saxon: 9.4.0.9 → 9.5.1-8
   1. scala-test: 2.0 → 2.2.6
   1. metrics: 2.2.0 (Yammer) → 3.1.2 (DropWizard/CodaHale)
   1. argot: 1.0.1  → 1.0.4
1. Breaking Change: The ```repeating``` attribute is now honored correctly by header parameters. New default is ```repeating="false"```.
1. Breaking Change: If there are multiple repeating headers parameters of the same name then *all* header values must correctly validate
   against *all* header parameters.
1. Added support for the rax:anyMatch extension. On a repeating header
   parameter adding ```rax:anyMatch="true"``` means that the header correctly validates if *any* header vaule validates. This was the default
   behavior for header parameters before this version.
1. The wadltest cli utility now allows setting Content-Type of a sample response by passing it in a ```respType``` query parameter.
1. Clean up: Minor cleanup of code to address static analysis findings and remove deprication warnings.
1. Fixed a bug where a missing item in the priority map did not error out correctly.

## Release 1.1.4 (2016-01-01) ##
1. Added support for default values in required headers.
1. Added a new CLI tool (wadltest) that runs api-checker on command for manual testing, this replaces the sample filter and filter-test-app.
1. Added start-up scripts for CLI utilities. Placing bin in the system path in *nix environments should allow easy running of CLI tools.
1. Fixed a bug where header parameters with the same name, but no fixed value, were not handled correctly.
1. Clean up: The -v/--validate option was removed from wadl2checker in favor of the -D/--dont-validate used by the other CLI utilities.
   This inverts the default behavior in wadl2checker, but normalizes it across all the CLI utilities to validate by default.
1. Clean up: Cleaned the code base of nasty tab characters.
1. Clean up: Brought back an ignored test that was disabled because of a previous bug with wadl-tools.
1. Updated wadl-tools: 1.0.31 → 1.0.32. This addressed a number of bugs affecting this project:
   1. Fixed a bug where multiple slashes // on the root resource (/) with a method was creating empty resources.
   1. Fixed a bug where a WADL with no resources was not handled correctly.


## Release 1.1.3 (2015-11-10) ##
1. Added missing xsd-grammar-transform (g) option to wadl2checker.
1. Added the ability to disable checker validation in wadl2dot.
1. Added support for the rax:metadata extension. The rax:metadata extension can be configured
   on a WADL as an attribute at the resource level. It is always enabled when rax:roles is enabled.
1. Added support for spaces in role names in the rax:roles extension by means of non-breaking space (NBSP) characters.
1. Clean up: The DateUtils class was converted from Java to Scala.
1. Clean up: Cleaner Scala code when handling optional values through out the project.
1. Clean up: Removed outdated graphs from the project.
1. Fixed a bug where CLI utilities were not displaying the correct version.
1. Fixed a bug where an incorrect error message was given when a resource had multiple methods of the same type.
1. Fixed a bug where default checker values were not correctly filled in where checker validation was turned off.
1. Fixed a bug in checker validation where under certain circumstances an optional METHOD_FAIL state was marked as required.
1. Updated wadl-tools: 1.0.29 → 1.0.31.  This addressed a number of bugs affecting this project
   1. Fixed a bug where multiple slashes // in a resource path caused the creation of empty resources.
   1. Fixed a bug where WADL extensions were not correctly propagated to child resources.
   1. WADL-Tools is now aware of the rax:roles extension and can correctly merge multiple rax:roles attributes into one as part of the normalization process.


## Release 1.1.2 (2015-07-20) ##
1. Added the ability for the DelegationHandler to have the default component name of ```api-checker``` overridden.
This will allow multiple API-Checker instances to be utilized in a single application and have them be differentiated in the logs.

## Release 1.1.1 (2015-05-22) ##
1. Added the new ApiCoverageHandler to log the path taken by a request to a logger named ```api-coverage-logger```.
1. Fixed a bug where the Wadl2Checker and Wadl2Dot CLI utilities were accidentally placed in the test source tree. 

## Release 1.1.0 (2015-04-15) ##
1. Classes have been repackaged into different packages.
This breaks backwards compatibility for classes related to Result and Step
2. Added support for rax:captureHeader extension.  If added to a wadl param, it will put the value
into the header specified by the rax:captureHeader value.
3. Added an alias for rax:captureHeader="X-Device-Id" called rax:device=true
4. Fixed a bug where rax:roles were not masked on non-string header checks
5. Performance improvements to XSL stages of the checker builder

## Release 1.0.22 (2015-03-17) ##

1. Added step context for adding headers via the context.
1. Added inStep method to handlers to take an action to the step context between steps.
1. Added MethodLabelHandler that will check the step and apply the label if its a method to a header in the step context.
1. Enhancements to validation of checker XML to check that error states are correctly assigned.
1. Fixed an issue where HEADER_ANY and HEADERXSD_ANY did not have error states correctly assigned.

## Release 1.0.21 (2015-01-19) ##

## Release 1.0.20 (2014-12-18) ##

1. Checker format can now be loaded directly by a validator. The
checker document must end with a ```.checker``` extension or the query
component of the systemID must contain ```checker=true```.
1. Fixed an issue where dependencies are listed more than one time in
checker metadata.
1. Fixed an issue where having a header check next to rax:roles would
break raxRolesMask.
1. Updated to use log4j 2 in test and CLI utilities.
1. Updated http delegation library: 2.0.0 → 4.0.0.

## Release 1.0.19 (2014-11-06) ##

   1. The creation time
   1. The version of api-checker
   1. The user
   1. Dependencies that were used to build the checker
   1. Configuration options

case where a role name contained a non-alphanumeric character.
1. Fixed bug where a malformed URI resulted in a 500 error code instead of
400.
1. Fixed a potential bug where an NPE would result in the rare but
plausible case where a container does not provide access to an HTTP
header.
1. Fixed bug where single mismatch method and URI errors contain the
same priority as multiple mismatch errors.
1. HTTP servlet request mocks now handle HTTP headers in a case
insensitive manner.
1. Licensed code under Apache License version 2.0.

## Release 1.0.17 (2014-05-25) ##

1. New strategy when deciding error message that involves longest path
from Start and a priority value based on step type.
1. Fixed bug in xpath join optimization where WELL_XML steps were not
always correctly handled.
1. Better logging using slf4j.
1. Fixed bug where Saxon 9.3 was added as a dependency in addition to Saxon 9.4.
1. Transition from maven-assembly-plugin to maven-shade-plugin when
creating single jar cli utils.
1. Updated wadl-tools: 1.0.22 → 1.0.25.

## Release 1.0.16 (2014-02-10) ##

1. Added raxRolesMask. Normally api-checker will return 403s when
authorization is denied.  When the raxRolesMask feature is enabled,
404s or 405s will be returned instead to hide the fact that failure is
due to lack of privileges.
1. The removeDups optimization can now correctly handle METHOD\_FAIL
and URL\_FAIL steps with no match.
1. Fixed bug where the instrumented handler was not counting steps
correctly.
1. Fixed a potential bug where METHOD\_FAIL and URL\_FAIL messages
could be confused with one another in the removeDups optimization.
1. Fixed a bug where the next attribute is not taken into account in
the header join optimization.
1. Fixed a bug in the prune step transform where checker elements may
not be copied correctly.
1. Updated wadl-tools: 1.0.21 → 1.0.22

## Release 1.0.15 (2014-01-14) ##

1. Added preserveRequestBody. Normally api-checker will simply stream the request
body through the state machine for validation. This works fine for a single validator,
but if multiple validators are used this will cause unexpected errors. preserveRequestBody
will add an extra step in the state machine to 'save' the request body in a buffer
so as validators further down the line can read it. Turning this feature on will add an extra
step in the state machine to capture the request body.
1. Updated XPath join optimization to be able to join adjacent mergable XSLs.
1. Updated wadl-tools: 1.0.20 → 1.0.21
1. Fixed issue: rax:roles in method references were not handled correctly. 
1. Enable implicit conversions in core tests. Removes warnings during compilation.

   1. argot: 0.3.5  → 1.0.1

## Release 1.0.12 (2013-10-23) ##

1. Added support for rax:roles extension.  rax:roles extension can be configured
on a WADL as an attribute at the resource or method level.  A request is checked
for authorization if the the rax roles check is enabled.  If enabled, and the 
requested resource or method has a rax:roles defined, the request must have a 
header value of X-Roles with a header value that matches one of the defined values
in rax:roles.

## Release 1.0.11 (2013-10-14) ##

1. Added utility class for headers.  Modified request wrapper to not split
headers on commas by default.

## Release 1.0.10 (2013-08-16) ##

1. Initial support for JSON Schema. Currently a single JSON schema can
be associated with the WADL. Validation is applied to all JSON media
type requests unless a resource or representation is marked with rax:ignoreJSONSchema="true"
1. Fixed a bug where a representation without a mediatype was being
processed as if it were an XML media type
