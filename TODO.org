   2. [ ] Preporc should support XSL parameters
   3. [ ] JSONx should be supported
   4. [ ] Should be able to use in not xml types
   5. [ ] Write test with noJoin on actual error message produced.
** TODO XPath check enhancements[0/6]
   1. [ ] Better errors when multiple XPath expressions fail --
      display.
   2. [ ] Normalize namespaces correctly in XPATHs from WADL -- prune
